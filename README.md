# Computer Learns to Play Jetpack Joyride: An Evolutionary Neural Network Visualizer
A neural network applied to Jetpack Joyride visualizing learning in real time. Using the [NEAT Python library](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and a modified version of a pre-existing [Python implementation of Jetpack Joyride](https://github.com/HugoLaurencon/JetPack-Joyride-game-in-Python), I configured an evolutionary neural network to develop winning strategies, using both positive and negative reinforcement through a tanh activation function and high-scoring genomes used to create subsequent generations.


## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.X

### Getting Started
- Install [[NEAT-Python]](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- Install [[pygame]](https://www.pygame.org/)
- Clone this repo

## Running

Navigate to this directory in terminal and execute command `python3 main.py`

### Configuration

The neural network configurations are located in `config-feedforward.txt` if you wish to change how the program learns.
